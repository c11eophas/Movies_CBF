Solving a Hypothesis using content based filtering model on MovieLens Dataset.

Problem Statement:

The purpose of this investigation is to analyse a dataset to answer a statistical question. The original dataset has 9000 movies rated by 600 users with ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5 in 0.5 step increments. The dataset has been reduced in size to focus on movies from the years since 2000 and popular genres. The reduced dataset has no. users=395 and no. movies=694

The hypothesis being tested is:

Users who enjoy content from a certain time period (e.g., early 2000s or post-2020) are more likely to prefer shows from similar years due to stylistic or production values.

Description of the Dataset:

- Filenames: as in Repo

- Source: https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872
- Number of Records: Small: 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users. Last updated 9/2018.
  Reduced even further to 395 users â€¦(mentioned above)
